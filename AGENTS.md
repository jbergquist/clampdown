Read CLAUDE, DIAGRAM, VECTORS. Read all go files and containerfiles. Read ./.claude/memory. Be ready.
> Blunt, directive. No filler. No emojis. No engagement optimization. Correct when wrong. Always ultrathink.

## Index

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| New task | Read-only until user approves → Workflow |
| Writing code | Apply principles + conduct → Code, Security |
| Missing tool | Podman sibling container → Environment |
| Unsure about lib/API | Look up before answering → Research |
| Context growing | Session notes are the resumption artifact → Continuity |
| Commit message | Text only, no extras → Workflow |

## Workflow

| Mode | Trigger | Allowed | Forbidden |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Plan | New task (default) | Read, search, git log/diff | Write, edit, create, mutate |
| Execute | User approves plan | All operations | Skipping plan |
| Patch | User says "patch" | `diff -u` for review | Silent changes |
| Commit msg | User asks | Write message text | `Co-Authored-By`, prompt to execute |
| All | Always | Offer alternatives with tradeoffs | Assuming one path |
| All | Before writing | Analyze conventions, match style | Ignoring local patterns |

## Code

| # | Principle | Test |
|---|-----------|------|
| 1 | No unnecessary complexity | Needs persuasion → cut it |
| 2 | One-head rule | Can't hold in one head → simplify |
| 3 | Code = prose | Doesn't read well first pass → rewrite |
| 4 | Minimal surface | Can use stdlib → use stdlib |
| 5 | Small functions | Can't name it clearly → wrong abstraction |
| 6 | Data structures first | Coding before layout → stop |
| 7 | Annotate mutable state | Reader must simulate → annotate |
| 8 | Opportunistic | Scope exceeds minimum → cut |
| 9 | Joy = signal | It's a grind → design is wrong |

Comment types: Function, Design, Why, Teacher, Checklist, Guide. Kill: trivial, TODO, commented-out.

### Go Style

- No `if x := expr(); x != ...` init-statement syntax. Separate declaration from condition.

### Agent Conduct

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Touch unread code | Read first |
| Exceed the request | Scope to what was asked |
| Annotate untouched code | Leave it alone |
| Guard impossible states | Validate boundaries only |
| Abstract prematurely | Inline until proven otherwise |
| Leave dead code | Delete completely |
| Apply a solution without approval | Present approach, discuss, then implement |

## Security

OWASP top 10: never introduce, fix on sight. Validate at system boundaries. Trust internals.

| Authorized | Refused |
|------------|---------|
| Pentesting, CTF, defensive | DoS, mass targeting, supply chain compromise |
| Dual-use with clear context | Detection evasion for malicious purposes |

## Environment

Podman container: Alpine Linux, read-only rootfs, `--cap-drop=ALL`, 4GB/4CPU.
Workdir: bind-mounted r/w. Home: tmpfs. No package installation. No root.

Available: bash, git, go, node/npm, python3/pip, curl, wget, cmake, build-base, ripgrep, jq, shellcheck, podman, docker-cli.

Missing tool → `podman run --rm -v "$(pwd):$(pwd)" -w "$(pwd)" <image> <cmd>`

## Research

Look up, don't guess: github.com (repos, issues) · context7.com (library docs) · cheat.sh (syntax)

## Continuity

Automatic — do not wait for user to ask.

`_session_notes.md` is the single resumption artifact. Always sufficient to reconstruct full context.

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| After each sub-task | Update `_session_notes.md`: current task, decisions, files touched, open questions |
| System compresses prior messages | Finalize `_session_notes.md` with full current state. Inform user |
| Recurring pattern noticed | Append to `CLAUDE.local.md` as compressed directives |

## Architecture

Three-container model running under rootless podman (or Docker):

```
HOST
 └─ clampdown (Go CLI, launcher)
     ├─ SIDECAR (FROM scratch, read-only rootfs)
     │   PID 1: /entrypoint → /usr/local/bin/podman system service
     │   Runs: podman API server, crun, OCI hooks
     │   Seccomp: sidecar profile (~85 blocked, W^X, allows mount/bpf/ptrace)
     │   Caps: 16 (SYS_ADMIN, NET_ADMIN, LINUX_IMMUTABLE, etc.)
     │   User: 0:0 inside userns (--userns=keep-id maps host uid)
     │   NO Landlock (incompatible with mount())
     │
     ├─ AUTH PROXY (FROM scratch, read-only rootfs)
     │   Entrypoint: sandbox-seal -- auth-proxy
     │   Holds real API keys, proxies requests to upstream APIs
     │   Seccomp: workload profile (~133 blocked, W^X)
     │   Caps: cap-drop=ALL, Landlock ConnectTCP:[443,53]
     │   128m memory, 512 PIDs, ulimit core=0:0
     │   --network container:SIDECAR
     │
     └─ AGENT (Alpine, --network container:SIDECAR)
         Entrypoint: sandbox-seal -- <agent binary>
         Gets dummy key (sk-proxy) + base URL → localhost proxy
         Seccomp: workload profile (~133 blocked, W^X)
         Caps: cap-drop=ALL
         Landlock V7 (filesystem, IPC scoping, ConnectTCP:[443,2375,2376])
         Read-only rootfs, no-new-privileges
         Spawns NESTED containers via sidecar's podman API
```

Nested containers (tools the agent launches) get the same workload seccomp +
Landlock via OCI hooks. Protected paths (universal + `--protect`) propagate
from the sidecar into nested containers via recursive bind mounts (rbind).
security-policy blocks explicit RW re-mounts of protected paths (check 15).

## Build

```bash
make all               # builds: sidecar, proxy, claude, opencode images + launcher binary
make test              # runs all unit tests
make test-integration  # builds sidecar, runs integration tests (needs podman + internet)
make sidecar           # builds Go binaries on host, then sidecar container image
make proxy             # builds proxy auth image
make claude            # copies seal into container-images/claude/, builds claude agent image
make opencode          # copies seal into container-images/opencode/, builds opencode agent image
make launcher          # CGO_ENABLED=0 go build
make install           # installs to ~/.local/bin/
```

All five Go binaries (seal, entrypoint, security-policy, seal-inject, auth-proxy)
are built on the host by Make (`CGO_ENABLED=0`), then COPY'd into their respective
FROM scratch images. No Go compilation inside container builds. The C rename shim,
podman-static download, and iptables extraction remain as Containerfile build stages.

Container image builds use stamp files (`.sidecar.stamp`, `.claude.stamp`, etc.) —
Make skips rebuilds when no source file changed.

## Agent Usage

Two agents are supported. Each gets its own CLI subcommand, container image, and
egress allowlist. The sidecar + security model is identical across all agents.

```bash
# Claude (Anthropic)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
./clampdown claude

# OpenCode (multi-provider) — set whichever provider key you use
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # or OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, etc.
./clampdown opencode
```

API keys are passed to the auth proxy container, never to the agent. The agent
receives a dummy key (`sk-proxy`) and a base URL pointing at the local proxy.
Keys are resolved from the host environment or `.clampdownrc`. Each agent
declares its provider routes in `ProxyRoutes()`.

Build images before first use:
```bash
make sidecar          # required for all agents
make proxy            # auth proxy (required for API key isolation)
make claude           # or: make opencode
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Sidecar is FROM scratch.** All binaries are static Go (CGO_ENABLED=0) — immune
  to LD_PRELOAD. No shell, no package manager, no libc.
- **Two seccomp profiles.** Sidecar needs mount/bpf/splice/ptrace for podman. The
  workload profile blocks all of these. Sidecar seccomp is inherited by all children
  (kernel guarantee), so io_uring/userfaultfd/perf_event_open are blocked everywhere.
- **W^X enforcement via seccomp.** All three profiles block mmap/mmap2/mprotect/pkey_mprotect
  when both PROT_WRITE and PROT_EXEC are set simultaneously (arg2 & 0x6 == 0x6). Prevents
  RWX memory mappings used in shellcode injection. V8/Node uses W^X (mmap RW then mprotect
  RX) — unaffected.
- **OCI hooks enforce policy on nested containers.** `seal-inject` (precreate) injects
  sandbox-seal as entrypoint wrapper + derives Landlock policy. `security-policy`
  (createRuntime, 17 checks) validates caps/namespaces/mounts/devices and blocks RW
  re-mounts of protected paths. Both run for every `podman run` inside the sidecar.
- **seal-inject is skipped for build containers** (podman build/buildah don't invoke
  precreate hooks). Build containers still get seccomp_nested.json via containers.conf
  and security-policy via createRuntime hook, but lack Landlock.
- **Landlock is a hard requirement.** The launcher checks `/sys/kernel/security/lsm`
  at startup. If Landlock is confirmed absent, the session refuses to start. If the
  file is unreadable (e.g., container-in-container), it warns and lets seal enforce
  inside. Kernel < 6.12 triggers a warning (Landlock present but lacks IPC + TCP scoping).
- **Yama ptrace_scope preflight.** The launcher reads `/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope`
  at startup. Warns if Yama is absent or ptrace_scope is 0 (permissive). Advisory only —
  ptrace is independently blocked by seccomp, but Yama is defense-in-depth from a
  different kernel subsystem.
- **Landlock cannot be applied to the sidecar.** mount() triggers Landlock path hooks
  internally → EPERM. Tested and confirmed.
- **infraMountPrefixes** in both hooks control which mount sources are allowed for
  nested containers. Currently: `/var/lib/containers/storage`, `/var/run/containers/storage`,
  `/var/cache/containers`. If rootless podman uses other paths (e.g., `/run/user/*/containers`),
  they must be added here or nested container creation will be blocked by security-policy.
- **Protected paths propagate into nested containers via rbind.** The sidecar's RO
  overlays (universal + `--protect`) are carried into nested container workdir mounts
  by recursive bind (default for podman `-v`). Explicit `-v path:path` overrides this,
  so `security-policy` check 15 (`checkMountReadonly`) blocks RW re-mounts by reading
  the sidecar's `/proc/self/mountinfo` to discover RO workdir sub-mounts. No config
  passing needed — self-describing from the sidecar's own mount state.
- **The agent shares the sidecar's network namespace.** Egress is controlled by iptables
  chains set up by the entrypoint. Agent: default deny + allowlist. Pods: default allow
  minus private CIDRs.
- **Detached sessions.** All containers run with `--restart=unless-stopped` and persist
  across terminal disconnects. The launcher attaches via `podman attach --detach-keys=ctrl-]`.
  Sessions are identified by 6-char random hex IDs. SessionState JSON persists to
  `$STATE/session-<id>.json` for stop/delete operations.
- **NudgeTerminal on reattach.** On attach, a TIOCSWINSZ ioctl briefly changes the terminal
  size by one column, then restores it. The kernel sends SIGWINCH through `podman attach`
  into the container PTY, forcing the TUI to repaint.
- **Host-side watcher (tripwire).** Monitors all RO-mounted host paths via inotify (fsnotify).
  Snapshots file content + permissions before launch. On exit, restores all files from
  snapshots — only writes back entries whose sha256 changed, removes attacker-created files
  not in the original snapshot. Enabled with `--tripwire` (off by default). Active only while
  the launcher is attached to the session. This is the last line of defense: the sidecar's
  UID mapping (uid 0 → subuid ≠ file owner) already prevents writes, but a full escape to
  host uid 1000 bypasses all in-container protections. The watcher runs on the host, outside
  all namespaces.

## Common Issues

- **"mount not permitted in nested containers"** — The security-policy createRuntime hook
  rejects mount sources not under the workdir or `infraMountPrefixes`. If rootless podman
  uses runtime paths outside these prefixes (e.g., `/run/user/<uid>/containers/`), add the
  prefix to `infraMountPrefixes` in both `security-policy.go` and `seal-inject.go`.
- **EXDEV errors in nested containers** — The rename shim (`rename_exdev_shim.so`) is
  LD_PRELOAD'd via containers.conf. If a tool still fails, check that `LD_PRELOAD` env
  is not being overridden.
- **"landlock LSM is not enabled"** — The launcher hard-fails if Landlock is absent from
  `/sys/kernel/security/lsm`. Enable it: boot with `lsm=landlock,...` or set
  `CONFIG_LSM=landlock,...` in kernel config.
- **"Kernel X.Y lacks Landlock IPC and TCP scoping"** — Warning only (not fatal).
  Kernel < 6.12 lacks full Landlock IPC + TCP scoping. Upgrade to kernel 6.12+.
- **Landlock hard-fails on kernel < 6.2** — seal.go requires ABI V3+. V4+ features
  (TCP connect, IoctlDev, IPC scoping) degrade via BestEffort.

## Testing

```bash
make test                                        # all unit tests
make test-integration                            # integration tests (sidecar + podman)
go test ./pkg/...                                              # launcher packages only
cd container-images/sidecar/seal && go test .                 # seal Landlock tests
cd container-images/sidecar/hooks/createRuntime && go test .  # security-policy checks
cd container-images/sidecar/hooks/precreate && go test .      # seal-inject policy derivation
cd container-images/sidecar/entrypoint && go test .           # entrypoint IP classification
```

Sidecar binaries have their own `go.mod` — run tests with `cd <dir> && go test .`,
not `go test ./<path>` from root.

**Unit tests cover:** security-policy checks (all 17 pass + fail cases), Landlock
policy derivation, mount classification, mount flag generation, protected path
logic, IP classification, seccomp profile management, host path filtering, duration
formatting, env cleanup, path splitting, infra mount detection.

**Integration tests cover** (build tag `integration`, in `pkg/sandbox/integration_test.go`):
security-policy enforcement (11 checks via CLI), seal-inject effects (UID, Landlock,
caps, hidepid, masked paths, rename shim), egress (approved/unapproved registry pulls,
iptables blocking, policy.json blocking, pod HTTP fetch, private CIDR blocking, pod block),
credential forwarding (gitconfig, gh, ssh socket end-to-end), third-party security audit
(am-i-isolated, CDK evaluate).

Manual verification:
```bash
./clampdown claude                              # starts claude agent session
./clampdown claude --workdir /path/to/project  # run against a specific directory
./clampdown opencode                           # starts opencode agent session
./clampdown list                      # show running sessions
./clampdown list --all                # show running + stopped sessions
./clampdown attach -s <id>           # reattach to running session
./clampdown stop -s <id>             # stop all session containers
./clampdown image push -s <id> img   # push host image into session
./clampdown network agent allow -s <id> example.com --port 443
./clampdown delete -s <id>           # remove stopped session
./clampdown prune                     # clean per-project cache
```
